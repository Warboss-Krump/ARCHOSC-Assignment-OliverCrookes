<h1>My name is: Warboss Krump
        
 </h1>
<p>Lab 2 Placeholder</p>
I created a repository for the Architectures, Operating Systems and The Cloud Module
<p>

</p>
I created a Workspace folder and have taken a screenshot of said folder whilst ensuring to give all files clear naming conventions.
<p>
<img src = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Warboss-Krump/ARCHOSC-Assignment-OliverCrookes/refs/heads/main/Pictures/Git%20init%20command.png>
</p> 
Used the “Open in terminal” function via right clicking on my project folder to open the command line straight to this location. I also used the “git init” command to make an empty git repository in this location. 
<p>
<img src = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Warboss-Krump/ARCHOSC-Assignment-OliverCrookes/refs/heads/main/Pictures/ARCHOSC%20Repository.png>
</p> 
Created a new repository for the ARCHOSC Assignment within Github. 
<p>
<img src = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Warboss-Krump/ARCHOSC-Assignment-OliverCrookes/refs/heads/main/Pictures/git%20pull%20origin%20main.png>
</p> 
Used the “git remote add origin” command and the “git pull origin main” command to link my repository to github. 
<p>
<img src = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Warboss-Krump/ARCHOSC-Assignment-OliverCrookes/refs/heads/main/Pictures/Completed%20Name%20Website.png>
</p> 
I created a new website in Visual Studio Code and edited it to state my name. 
<p>
<img src = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Warboss-Krump/ARCHOSC-Assignment-OliverCrookes/refs/heads/main/Pictures/Git%20Commit.png>
</p> 
I used the “git commit” command to commit to my local repository. 
<p>
<img src = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Warboss-Krump/ARCHOSC-Assignment-OliverCrookes/refs/heads/main/Pictures/Updated%20Repository.png>
</p> 
I used the Git push command to update my online repository with my lab files
<p>
<img src = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Warboss-Krump/ARCHOSC-Assignment-OliverCrookes/refs/heads/main/Pictures/Website%20Colour%20Changes.png>
</p> 
I updated the background colour, font colour and my name within the website to reflect my Github account name.
<p>
<img src = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Warboss-Krump/ARCHOSC-Assignment-OliverCrookes/refs/heads/main/Pictures/Colour%20and%20Font%20Changes%20Committed.png>
</p>
I committed my changes both locally and on to my Github repository


<p>Part 2: Reflection</p>
<p>I learned how to create a github repository via command line again. This would be useful in any industry placement as source control is important, be it as solo or in a team.
<p>I also created a website with basic formatting and picture creation. This would be a great tool for providing updates on a website where a team could see this.
<p>Lastly, I incrementally pushed all the changes to GitHub so I could revert back to any previously working versions of my website. This would be useful in any development project as version control would ensure less mistakes and catastrophic issues from occurring. </p>
